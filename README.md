# Welcome to Martin Monkman's github pages.

A modest collection of ten million random thoughts about data science, digital humanities, learning, tools, and other things that might strike me as being worthy of comment.

1. This blog's layout is based on a fork of Barry Clark's [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now).  If you're out there, Barry, thanks.
2. github pages now uses the [kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/index.html) flavour of Markdown. Need the [handy Quick Reference sheet](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html)?
