This is the github blog of Martin Monkman.

### Virtual presence

In addition to this blog, you can find me elsewhere on the web:

* [bayesball.blogspot.com](bayesball.blogspot.com), my irregular blogging about baseball data and the statistical software R, often simultaneously.
* [github](https://github.com/MonkmanMH)
* [github gists](https://gist.github.com/MonkmanMH)

I contribute to the R package [Lahman](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Lahman/index.html), which provides the tables from Sean Lahman's Baseball Database as a set of R data.frames.
